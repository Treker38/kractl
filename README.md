It should work if you create a new bot. Tested on python 3.8, works on 3.7.

The bot does not work properly when the bot joins a server while the script is offline, I would recommend you to make a new bot, add the token and start the script. And then invite. Otherwise, read the wiki page for more info about the settings. https://github.com/kurpingspace2/my-son/wiki/settings.txt

Many errors are due to invalid settings. This is not a problem if the bot is running 24/7.
Invalid settings can be caused by code updates ;) and when the bot has joined a server while the script is offline.
